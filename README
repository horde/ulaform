What is Ulaform?
----------------

Ulaform is a PHP-based dynamic HTML form creation and generation system. Ulaform
allows users to create sophisticated forms using a web browser, and then render
the forms within other web pages by a simple PHP include inside a <?php ... ?>
tag, or in other Horde applications through the Horde Block api.
Ulaform is intended to replace other dynamic form generation techniques (such as
FrontPage forms which require the FrontPage extensions on the server, or CGI
scripts which require some programming ability).

Ulaform is based on the Horde_Form library of the Horde framework. This gives it
some useful capabilities: the ability to automatically validate data, using
JavaScript if available (or re-rendering of the form if not); the ability to use
GET or POST transparently; and others.
