This document contains instructions for installing the Ulaform form
wizard.

For information on the capabilities and features of Ulaform, see the
file README_ in the top-level directory of the Ulaform distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Ulaform requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Ulaform runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Ulaform.

   .. Important:: Ulaform 1.0 requires version 4.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Ulaform. Many of Ulaform's prerequisites are also
                  Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Ulaform's optional
                  features are configured via the Horde install.

2. SQL support in PHP.

   Ulaform store its data in an SQL database. Build PHP with whichever
   SQL driver you require; see the Horde INSTALL_ file for details.


Installing Ulaform
==================

Ulaform is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from
system to system. Conventionally, Ulaform is installed directly underneath
Horde in the webserver's document tree.

Since Ulaform is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL. For example, with the Apache webserver's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/ulaform-2.0.tar.gz
   mv ulaform-2.0 ulaform

and would then find Ulaform at the URL

   http://your-server/horde/ulaform/


Configuring Ulaform
===================

1. Configuring Horde for Ulaform

   a. Register the application

      In horde/config/registry.php, find the applications['ulaform'] stanza.
      The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of Ulaform relative
      to Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must
      update the 'fileroot' and 'webroot' settings to their correct
      values.

2. Creating the database table

   The specific steps to create the Ulaform database table depend
   on which database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in scripts/drivers/ to see if a script already
   exists for your database type. If so, you should be
   able to simply execute that script as superuser in your
   database. (Note that executing the script as the "horde" user will
   probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using
   the file ulaform_tasks.sql as a starting point. If you need
   assistance in creating databases, you may wish to let us know on
   the Ulaform mailing list.

3. Configuring Ulaform.

   To configure Ulaform, change to the config/ directory of the
   installed distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration
   "dist" files without the "dist" suffix:

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Documentation on the format of those files can be found in each
   file.   With the exception of the conf.* files (see below),
   the other files in config/ need only be modified if you wish
   to customize Ulaform's appearance or behavior, as the defaults will
   be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuring of Ulaform.  Use the Horde "Administration" menu item to get
   to the Administration page, and then click on the "Configuration"
   icon to get the Configuration page.  Select "Tasks" from the selection
   list of applications, and click on the "Configure" button.  Fill in or
   change any configuration values as needed.  When done click on "Generate
   Tasks Configuration" to generate the conf.php file.  If your web server
   doesn't have write permissions to the Ulaform configuration directory or
   file, it will not be able to write the file.  In this case, cut and
   paste the returned configuration information into the file
   ulaform/config/conf.php.

   Note for international users:  Ulaform uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are
   found in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available
   for your locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having
   trouble using a provided translation, please see the horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS
   file for instructions.

4. Testing Ulaform

   Use Ulaform to create, modify, and delete forms. Test at
   least the following:

     - Creating a form
     - Modifying a form
     - Viewing and submitting a form
     - Deleting a form


Sample Usage
============

Ulaform can be embedded internally within Horde in any application which
supports the Horde Blocks API.

Otherwise Ulaform can be called from any web page with the following simple
php code:

   <?php
   include <pathtoulaform> . '/display.php?form_id=2';
   ?>
